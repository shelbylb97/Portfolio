# Portfolio
Revised portfolio project. I didn't set up the last repository correctly so I decided just start over instead of pushing to the old one. It is currently very unfinished due to some debugging that is taking longer than expected. The goal is to have a carousel for the About me section and basic versions of the other two pages with buttons that link you to said pages. I struggled with the image sizing on portfolio. The carousel is currently bugged. I'm submitting this one as a WIP and will resubmit the finished version. I used a couple youtube tutorials that i have listed either in the comments or in the commits.
